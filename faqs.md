# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Amp Rack?
Amp Rack is a Guitar Effects Processor for Android. You can use it to put some effects on your Guitar, voice, or any other instrument.

### But what is What is Amp Rack really?
Amp Rack is a LADSPA Plugin Host for Android. It supports LADSPA SDK v1.1 plugins. Since ANdroid does not (easily) support loading dynamic modules, a lot (!) of plugins (shared files) have been included in the APK. 

Amp Rack takes in audio input, runs it through loaded plugins, and sends output to an audio device, optionally recording it to an audio file.

We use the [Oboe](https://github.com/google/oboe) framework by Google, and Amp Rack achieves Low Latency due to native code and high performance tuning.
